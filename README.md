<h1> Binary Chatbot 2.0: Textbot </h1>

<p> The Binary Chatbot 2.0 is an upgraded, expanded version of one my previous projects, the Binary Chatbot. While I was happy with the final result of the first project, I felt that there was potential to use the concept to create something even better, with more options to “chat” with the bot, and the bot will now send a text instead of responding in the command line. The idea of this project is to make the user’s experience difficult, altering the notion that a computer is supposed to make your life easier. That chatbot prompts are simple, single phrases, however the computer only understands them when they are written in binary. Most of Textbot’s data is retrieved from free public APIs. <p>

<p> It is very easy for us to use computers, and while a computer is capable of doing many things we can’t, it needs to break our concepts up into its simplest parts to understand it. Contrary to a normal chatbot, you talk to this computer in binary, the computer’s language. The purpose of making this project a chatbot is to place emphasis on the idea of this communication between human and computer. Communicating with this computer is long and tedious, suggesting a reverse of roles. <p>

<h2>How to use Binary Chatbot 2.0</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Ensure keyboard is properly functioning by making sure it is switched to “on” and the wireless adapter is plugged into the Pi
 <li>Type Python3 chatbot.py into the command line and hit enter to run the program. 
 <li>Attached is a legend containing all the binary codes for latin lowercase letters. These codes are used to communicate with the chatbot.
</ul>


<h2>To communicate:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>After inputting a single binary letter code, hit enter to proceed to the next letter
 <li>When all desired letters are inputted, continue to hit enter until the end of the user input prompts (there are nine     lines available to input)
 <li>After you type your message, the chatbot will respond accordingly
</ul>
